# Web Development Portfolio

## Description

The purpose of this challenge was to use the skills learned in Module 2 of Bootcamp to create a portfolio for my previous and future work. In this project, I put my HTML and CSS skills to test. I structured my webpage with HTML, adding sections for About Me, My Work, and Contact Me. In the HTML, I used class selectors and the id elements to pinpoint where I wanted different styling options. In the CSS, I coded my styling choices according to what I liked! I made sure that the container for my Challenge 01 project was bigger to highlight the project. I also made different choices in color, font, font-size, borders, justification, etc. in order to organize my content into a structure that made readability and accessibility better for the user that will view my page. This challenge was especially important to me because once I pursue a career in coding, I will have a place to display my deployed projects for future employers to see, so there's a very useful real-world application to it.
